Maxwell Beasley is an accountant for Aurora Financial Corp. where he enjoys the normal, everyday grind of his job and his evening drinking sessions with his best friend, Avis Barrett, one of the IT contractors of his corporation. However, its not long before something is amiss. It started with a few, and in a large corporation its unlikely anyone will take any notice, however the scale increased exponentially. Maxwell becomes increasingly suspicious of the goings-on of the higher-ups as more and more of his coworkers begin disappearing without a trace. Play as Maxwell in this rollercoaster ride as he falls down a rabbit hole he never fathomed existed.

Open world first-person RPG.
